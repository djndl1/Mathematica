# Bayesian 

Statistics based on the [Bayesian interpretation of probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) where probability expresses a _degree of belief_ in an event. The degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event, such as the result of previous experiments, or on personal beliefs about the event.

Bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies some prior probability, which is then updated to a posterior probability in the light of new, relevant data (evidence).

Bayesian methodology

- The use of unknown quantities to model all sources of uncertainty in statistical models including uncertainty resulting from lack of information.

- The need to determine the prior probability distribution taking into account the available prior information

- The sequential use of Bayes' formula: when more data become available, calculate the posterior distribution using Bayes' formula; subsequently, the posterior distribution becomes the next prior.

- The probability that can be assigned to a hypothesis can be in a range from $0$ to $1$ if the truth value is uncertain.

the Bayesian statistics has a specific interpretation on Bayes' theorem. Given the theorem in the form

$$
{\displaystyle P(A\mid B)={\frac {P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}}}
$$

$A$ represents a proposition and $P(A)$ expresses one's belief about $A$ before evidence $B$ is taken into account. $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood function which quantities the extent to which the evidence $B$ supports the proposition $A$. $P(A|B)$ is posterior probability, the probability of the proposition $A$ after taking the evidence $B$ into account.

The general set of statistical can be divided into a number of activities, may of which, such as statistical inference, statistical modeling and design of experiments have special Bayesian versions.

## [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)

> Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population. See more [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/130867/inference-vs-estimation/130871)

In classical frequentist inference, model parameters and hypothesis are considered to be fixed. Probabilities are not assigned to parameters or hypotheses in frequentist inference.

In Bayesian inference, probabilities can be assgined to model parameters. Parameters can be represented as random variables. Bayesian inference uses Bayes' theorem to update probabilities after more evidence is obtained or known.
